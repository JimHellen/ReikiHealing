My name is James Hellen. I'm a licensed Massage therapist who specializes in medical massage as well traditional Swedish and Asian techniques to provide a truly therapeutic and healing experience for the physical body. Along with being a massage therapist, I'm also an advanced Reiki practitioner. Through this practice, I seek to heal the emotional, energetic, and spiritual aspects of the body. My mission goal through the services I provide is to heal the mind, body, and soul while being able to provide a safe escape from the stresses of everyday life. I'm able to truly emphasize this mission statement as I've been there, wounded and down myself.

Dealing with a crippling autoimmune condition that tremendously negatively impacted my life not only on a physical level but an emotional, mental and spiritual level as well. Everything within our bodies is connected and if one aspect is off it can set off a chain reaction of negative feelings. Through the inner work and my understanding of this concept, I was able to overcome my own struggles and learned to heal from within. We all have the gift and ability to heal from within, as low and as bad as we feel we can always turn it around and reach the highest of heights. This is what I want to teach to the world and truly give people their power back. Let's book a session today and take our power back.
